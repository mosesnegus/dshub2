    "## A Vectorized Solution To `fizzbuzz`\n",
    "\n",
    "`fizzbuzz` is a canonical \"coding interview\" problem. You might want to read this humorous take by Joel Grus who attempts to use tensor for to solve the problem: http://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/. The challenge is to iterate over the numbers from 1 to 100, printing \"fizz\" if the number is divisible by 3, \"buzz\" if the number is divisible by 5, \"fizzbuzz\" if the number is divisible by 15, and the number itself otherwise. Typically this problem is solved using for-loops and if-else statements and is used as a basic assessment of programming ability. Such a solution might look like this"
